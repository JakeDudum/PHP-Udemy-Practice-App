# Udemy-PHP-Practice-App

The main purpose of this app is to learn the basics and fundamentals of PHP from a Udemy Course before building out a complete PHP CMS project from said course. As such there is no live deployed version of the code found here, it is for learning purposes and reference only. The completed CMS Project code can be found here: [Udemy-PHP-CMS](https://github.com/JakeDudum/Udemy-PHP-CMS) and links for the course and instructor can be found in the [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments) section.
